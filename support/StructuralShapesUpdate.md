# Structural Shapes Module - Update Summary
May 28, 2025

## Overview of Changes
This document summarizes the recent updates to the LispCAD Structural Shapes Module.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Path Resolution
- Implemented integration with the centralized path resolver (LispCAD_PathResolver.lsp)
- Added fallback mechanisms for when the path resolver is unavailable
- Improved path detection for both new and legacy folder structures

### 2. Shape Selection UI
- Added interactive shape selection for all commands (HH, IB, CC, LL)
- Created a unified structural shape command (SS) for selecting any shape type
- Added ListShapes command to display all available shapes in a category

### 3. Enhanced Shape Data
- Added weight information to all shape profiles:
  - H-shapes (pounds per foot)
  - I-shapes (pounds per foot)
  - C-shapes (kilograms per meter)
  - L-shapes (pounds per foot)
- Added more shape profiles to the standard libraries
- Improved shape data format documentation

### 4. Code Improvements
- Centralized common functionality
- Added better error handling and messaging
- Improved search and display functions for shape data
- Fixed issues with shape loading in multi-user environments

### 5. Documentation
- Updated StructuralShapesGuide.md with new functionality
- Created test script (TestShapesModule.lsp) for demonstration and validation

## Files Modified
- src/core/LC_Structural_Shapes.lsp
- src/shapes/* (all shape data files)
- lib/shapes/* (all shape data files)
- AutoLoadShapes.lsp
- support/StructuralShapesGuide.md

## Files Created
- scripts/TestShapesModule.lsp

## Backward Compatibility
All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing installations. The module can:
- Work with both the new folder structure (lib/shapes) and legacy structure (src/shapes)
- Function without the path resolver if it's not available
- Use environment variables or direct paths when needed

## Testing Procedure
1. Load AutoLoadShapes.lsp in AutoCAD
2. Run the TestAllShapes command from scripts/TestShapesModule.lsp
3. Verify that all shape types are drawn correctly
4. Test the ListShapes command to verify shape data displays correctly
5. Use the SS command to draw various shapes interactively

## Future Improvements
- Add support for additional structural shapes (T-shapes, HSS/RHS)
- Implement customizable drafting standards
- Add annotation and dimensioning options
- Create an interactive shape browser with preview
- Implement metric/imperial unit conversion
