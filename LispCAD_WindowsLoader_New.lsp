;;; ===== LISPCAD WINDOWS LOADER REPLACEMENT =====
;;; This file replaces the complex 1000+ line LispCAD_WindowsLoader.lsp
;;; with a simple redirect to the unified loading system
;;; Created: December 2024

;; This file replaces the old LispCAD_WindowsLoader.lsp which had:
;; - 1000+ lines of code
;; - Hardcoded paths like "c:/Users/witch/OneDrive/Desktop/lispcad"
;; - Complex logic for finding and loading components
;; - Multiple redundant functions
