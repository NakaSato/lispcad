2. **OptimizeArray**
   - Type `OptimizeArray` at the command prompt
   - Enter your project location (latitude/longitude)
   - Specify site constraints (available area, roof pitch)
   - Review the optimization results showing recommended:
     - Panel tilt angle
     - Azimuth orientation
     - Row spacing for minimal shading
     - Expected energy yield

3. **SunPath**
   - Type `SunPath` at the command prompt

4. **SolarGCR** (Ground Coverage Ratio Calculator)
   - Type `SolarGCR` at the command prompt
   - Choose panel type from library or enter custom dimensions
   - Enter number of panels and array configuration
   - Define ground area (direct input, rectangular bounds, or drawing selection)
   - Review comprehensive GCR analysis including:
     - Calculated GCR percentage
     - Density classification (Low/Moderate/High/Very High)
     - Shading impact assessment
     - Land utilization efficiency
     - Optimization recommendations
   - Optionally create detailed analysis table in drawing
   - Use results to optimize array spacing and configuration

### Advanced Usage

   - Choose radiation model (simple or detailed)
   - Review the heat map visualization showing kWh/mÂ² per area

2. **SolarSetback**
   - Type `SolarSetback` at the command prompt
   - Select the roof perimeter
   - Choose local code requirements or enter custom values
   - The command generates the required setback lines with dimensions

3. **SolarStrings**
   - Type `SolarStrings` at the command prompt
   - Select panels to include in strings
   - Specify inverter parameters or select from library
   - Review the generated string connections and electrical diagram

4. **SolarInfoBlock**

   - Enter project information (client, address, etc.)
   - Select the solar array for automatic data extraction
   - Choose table style and placement location
   - The command generates a complete information table with system specs and production estimates

5. **CreateSolarConstructionLayers**
   - Type `CreateSolarConstructionLayers` at the command prompt
   - The command automatically creates a comprehensive set of standardized layers for solar construction plans
   - Layers are organized into logical categories (base, civil, electrical, structural, etc.)
   - Each layer is assigned an appropriate color and linetype
   - On supported AutoCAD versions, layer groups are created for easier management
   - For full details, see the [Solar Construction Layers Guide](SolarConstructionLayersGuide.md)

### Tips for Optimal Results

- Always start with `OptimizeArray` to establish best system parameters
- Use `SunPath` to identify potential shading obstacles
- Combine `SolarRadiation` with `OptimizeArray` for maximum energy yield
- Save common configurations as templates using the `SaveSolarTemplate` command
- Export results to reports using `ExportSolarReport` for client presentations

## Workflow Example

1. Create standardized layers with `CreateSolarConstructionLayers`
2. Analyze the best position for your array with `OptimizeArray`
3. Create the array layout with `SolarArray` (includes automatic GCR calculation)
4. Optimize array density with `SolarGCR` for detailed Ground Coverage Ratio analysis
5. Check shadow impact with `SunPath`
6. Analyze solar radiation with `SolarRadiation`
7. Add setback lines with `SolarSetback`
8. Design string connections with `SolarStrings`
9. Add components with `SolarLib`
10. Create an information block with `SolarInfoBlock` (includes GCR data)

## Ground Coverage Ratio (GCR) Analysis

The Ground Coverage Ratio is a critical metric in solar array design that balances energy density against shading losses. GCR is calculated as the ratio of total solar panel area to total ground area occupied by the array.

### Key GCR Concepts

- **GCR Range**: Typically 0.1 (10%) to 0.9 (90%)
- **Optimal GCR**: Usually around 0.4 (40%) for balanced performance
- **Low GCR (< 0.25)**: Minimal shading, inefficient land use
- **Moderate GCR (0.25-0.35)**: Balanced approach, good for most applications
- **High GCR (0.35-0.5)**: Efficient land use, acceptable shading losses
- **Very High GCR (> 0.5)**: Maximum density, significant shading consideration needed

### GCR Analysis Features

The `SolarGCR` command provides:
- Interactive panel and array configuration
- Multiple ground area input methods (direct, rectangular, drawing selection)
- Comprehensive analysis with density classification
- Shading impact assessment
- Land utilization efficiency rating
- Optimization recommendations
- Optional detailed results table creation in drawing

### Integration with Array Tools

- `SolarArray` command automatically calculates and displays GCR
- `OptimizeArray` can target specific GCR values
- Construction layers include dedicated `S-ARRAY-ANALYSIS` layer for GCR documentation
