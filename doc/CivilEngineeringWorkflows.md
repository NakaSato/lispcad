## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Layer State Management

```lisp
;; Create custom layer states for different project phases
(command "LAYERSTATE" "S" "SitePrep" 
         "C-DEMO-*,C-EXIST-*,C-SURV-*" "Y")

(command "LAYERSTATE" "S" "Earthwork" 
         "C-GRADE-*,C-EXCAV-*,C-FILL-*" "Y")

(command "LAYERSTATE" "S" "Infrastructure" 
         "C-ROAD-*,C-DRAIN-*,C-UTIL-*" "Y")
```

### 2. Automated Drawing Sequences

```lisp
;; Example: Automated road cross-section
(defun c:RoadXSection ()
  (setvar "CLAYER" "C-ROAD-CENTER")
  ;; Draw centerline
  (setvar "CLAYER" "C-ROAD-PAVE")
  ;; Draw pavement
  (setvar "CLAYER" "C-ROAD-BASE")
  ;; Draw base course
)
```

### 3. Integration with External Data

```lisp
;; Import survey data to appropriate layers
(defun ImportSurveyData ()
  (setvar "CLAYER" "C-EXIST-TOPO")
  ;; Import topographic data
  (setvar "CLAYER" "C-SURV-CONTROL")
  ;; Import control points
)
```

## Quality Control Workflows

### 1. Layer Audit

  (civil:list-active-layers)
  (civil:check-layer-standards)
  (civil:verify-color-compliance)
)
```

### 2. Drawing Standards Check
```lisp
;; Verify drawing meets civil engineering standards
(defun c:CivilStandardsCheck ()
  (check-layer-naming)
  (verify-color-scheme)
  (validate-linetype-usage)
)
```

### 3. Coordination Review
```lisp
;; Cross-check utility conflicts
(defun c:UtilityConflictCheck ()
  (setvar "CLAYER" "C-UTIL-WATER")
  (analyze-utility-crossings)
  (setvar "CLAYER" "C-UTIL-SEWER")
  (check-clearances)
)
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### Project Organization
1. **Start with complete layer set** - Use `CreateCivilLayers` with "All" option
2. **Use layer states** - Create states for different project phases
3. **Coordinate early** - Plan utility layouts before detailed design
4. **Follow standards** - Maintain consistent layer naming and colors

### Drawing Efficiency
1. **Leverage FastDraw** - Use Construction mode for automatic layer switching
2. **Use patterns** - Pattern mode for repetitive elements
3. **Batch operations** - Batch mode for multiple similar elements
4. **Precision work** - Precision mode for exact measurements

### Collaboration
1. **Layer standardization** - Ensure team uses same layer structure
2. **File coordination** - Use consistent file naming with layer prefixes
3. **Version control** - Track changes to layer structure
4. **Documentation** - Maintain layer usage documentation

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Mixing layer standards** - Don't mix civil and other layer systems inappropriately
2. **Color conflicts** - Avoid using same colors for different element types
3. **Layer proliferation** - Don't create unnecessary custom layers
4. **Missing coordination** - Always check utility conflicts

## Integration Examples

### With Solar Layers
```lisp
;; Site preparation for solar + civil work
(CreateCivilLayers)
(CreateSolarLayers)
;; Use C-DEMO-* for site prep
;; Use SOLAR-* for solar equipment
;; Coordinate on shared infrastructure layers
```

### With MEP Systems
```lisp
;; Civil utilities coordination with MEP
;; Use C-UTIL-* for site utilities
;; Use MEP layers for building systems
;; Coordinate at building interfaces
```

## Troubleshooting

### Layer Issues
- **Layers not creating:** Check AutoCAD permissions and layer naming conflicts
- **Colors wrong:** Verify color table and viewport overrides
- **FastDraw not working:** Reload both CivilEngineeringLayers.lsp and FastDraw files

### Performance
- **Slow layer switching:** Reduce number of active layers using layer states
- **Large file sizes:** Purge unused layers and optimize drawing
- **Memory issues:** Close unnecessary drawings and restart AutoCAD

### Standards Compliance
- **Layer naming:** Follow C-CATEGORY-ELEMENT convention strictly
- **Color coordination:** Use designated color ranges for each category
- **Documentation:** Maintain current layer usage documentation
